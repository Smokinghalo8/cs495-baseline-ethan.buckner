##Did I use AI?
>Yes, I used ChatGPT to help create a Python Unittest baseline, that I could edit to work for my project.
>
>Prompt: "Can you give me a basic Unittest example for Python?"
>
>What I did myself: I took the response chatGPT gave me and edited it to make it work for my code, I also created the rest of my Assignment by myself, no need for AI, just Python Documentation.
>
>I verified the AI responses by implementing it's response into my code.
